# tymeshift
In our real Tymeshift frontend application we have an "All locations" page where we display all the locations where company users are located. This task is designed to be a simple version of a real page we use and to give you a feeling of what your job will look like in Tymeshift. On the other hand we will be able to check how you handle a real requirement.
